## Intro

I am working on developing algorithms to learn dynamics models and then use them for control in robotics. I am especially interested in multi-agent settings that involve some coordination and/or competition. I am also interested in studying the emergent behavior that arises from ensembles of agents and using emergent behavior for control.

Currently, I am working at the Max Planck Institute as a PhD student under the supervision of Bernhard Sch√∂lkopf and Stefan Bauer. I earned a Master's degree in Computer Science in 2019 at the University of Washington, Seattle, USA, under Dieter Fox and Arunkumar Bryavan. Before that, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Physics, and Chemistry in 2018. In that time, I worked with Lutz Maibaum on analyzing molecular dynamics simulations to characterize the structure of cellular membranes. I also worked with Boris Blinov on simulating trapped ions to improve cooling for storing and processing quantum information.
