description: A benchmark for formal causal reasoning in LLMs
level: published
status: NeurIPS 2023
---

Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have led to a surge of interest in the capabilities of these models. However, it is still unclear how well these models can perform causal reasoning, a key aspect of intelligence. Here, I worked with several colleagues to develop a benchmark to introduce a novel task we call "causal inference in natural language."

This paper was published in the main proceedings of [NeurIPS 2023](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/hash/631bb9434d718ea309af82566347d607-Abstract-Conference.html).

## My Contribution

As one of the main authors, I helped design and implement the dataset generation process, including the simulation of causal models and the verbalization of the questions, answers, and step-by-step solutions. I also contributed to the writing of the paper and the presentation of the associated poster at the conference.
