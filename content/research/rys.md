This paper introduces the Rich Synthetic Scenario (RYS) framework, a general approach to leveraging the impressive generative capabilities of the large language models (LLMs) for high-quality synthetic benchmarks in natural language. The framework consists of three modules: a generator, a simulator, and a verbalizer, where only the generator uses an LLM to generate a realistic setting and any other specific information required by the simulator and verbalizer. Then the simulator generates a specific question and answer pair with any associated context which is then verbalized in a fully transparent system, to ensure that the semantics of the prompt are not changed. The paper showcases the application of RYS in developing a benchmark for causal reasoning which produces diverse and realistic scenarios with a principled ground truth.
