description: Tools to probe the latent space of autoencoders
level: published
status: NeurIPS 2022
---

In this paper, we investigate the latent space of autoencoders, a critical component in representation learning. We observe that autoencoders are approximately idempotent, which can be exploited to characterize the structure of the latent manifold. Based on this behavior, we develop a series of tools to probe the representation using interventions in the latent space to quantify the relationships between latent variables to better understand the latent space.

## My Contribution

As the main author of this work, I developed the core ideas, designed the experiments, and implemented all the associated code. I also wrote most of the paper and presented the poster for this project at the conference.
