In this work, we bridge the gap between recent pose estimation and tracking work to develop a powerful method for robots to track objects in their surroundings. Motion-Nets use a segmentation model to segment the scene, and then predict the relative 6D motion of each identified object between two consecutive frames. We train the Motion-Nets on a synthetic dataset with extensive domain randomization (simulated using MuJoCo) to allow Motion-Nets to perform zero-shot on unseen objects and environments.

This work was completed during my Master's at the University of Washington in the [Robot State and Estimation lab](https://rse-lab.cs.washington.edu/) under Dieter Fox, and was accepted to the [IROS 2019 workshop on The Importance of Uncertainty in Deep Learning for Robotics](https://nikosuenderhauf.github.io/roboticvisionchallenges/iros2019).

## My Contribution

This was my main project during my Master's, and I was responsible for the entire project from conception to publication. I developed the idea, designed the model, implemented the code, ran the experiments, and wrote the paper.
