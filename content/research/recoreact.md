Natural language offers a rich, expressive medium for capturing user preferences in recommendation systems, yet its structure and utility remain underexplored. We introduce RecoReact, a multi-domain dataset of approximately 600 users interacting with a simulated assistant across 3 rounds of 3 conversational turns each, in a hybrid interface combining natural language feedback, structured profiles, and item selections. Our analysis reveals that users express preferences and feedback in a variety of domain-specific ways that significantly shift both within and across interactions. In predictive tasks, natural language signals, and in particular full conversations, outperform static profiles and past behavior, with LLMs best able to leverage this input. These findings highlight the need for recommendation systems to support natural language input and embrace interactive, multi-turn engagement to better capture evolving user intent.
