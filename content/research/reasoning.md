In the rapidly evolving landscape of machine learning and natural language processing, effectively evaluating large language models (LLMs) remains a significant challenge due to a myriad of issues in current benchmarks such as biases, artifacts, sample leakage, etc. We suggest that the appropriate framework to systematically formulate and address these issues is causality, and advocate for more explicitly causal framings of experimental approaches and evaluation procedures to clearly communicate assumptions, find potential limitations, and identify principled tools for analysis. We propose a framework to identify and analyze useful Common Abstract Topologies (CATs) in the causal graphs of approaches and demonstrate how these can be used to gain insight into experiments through three case studies. Lastly, we advocate a more instrumentalist approach to causality through conceptual causal models to guide the design of experiments and analysis, thus leveraging the significant explanatory power of causality while also retaining its power and precision when needed.
