In this very challenging cooperative deduction game for 2 players, you and your partner need to communicate highly specific information through a very noisy and limited communication channel based on tenuous and highly ambiguous associations between dream-like images (such as those from [_Mysterium_](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/181304/mysterium)). Based on the game mechanics a relatively complex abstract language emerges, which can further be refined in a variety of ways to optimize communication efficiency. The game is highly engaging and offers a unique experience that relies on both creativity and deductive reasoning.

Although it can be played over the table, **Mystic Dialogue** is best played online, and I have implemented the game as a discord bot available [here](https://github.com/felixludos/ludos/blob/figged/ludos/games/mysterium/dialogue.py).
