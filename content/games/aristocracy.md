> *Aristocrats don't work. They own land, make money off their estate, and play cards in their château. Can you handle that?*

A strategy card game I created over the course of the Summer of 2018 (and beyond). Since then, I've also created several expansions and variants that add exciting new elements to the game.

You can find the rules of the game [here](https://github.com/felixludos/Games/blob/main/Aristocracy/Aristocracy.md), as well as variants and expansions in the repo. 

Generally, I would recommend playing the base game with the Journeys and Commissions expansions.
