> *Aristocrats don't work. They own land, make money off their estate, and play cards in their ch√¢teau. Can you handle that?*

A strategy card game created by Felix Leeb over the course of the Summer of 2018 (and beyond).

This repo contains the rules for the base game, as well as variants and expansions. Overall, I would recommend playing the base game with the Journeys and Commissions expansions.
