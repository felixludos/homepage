description: Jupyter notebooks to learn the core principles of quantum mechanics
level: published
---

I originally wrote these tutorials as a basic introduction to some of the core principles of quantum mechanics and quantum computing. The tutorials are meant for those with some sort of familiarity with computational or engineering work, but in principle, anyone interested in quantum computing should benefit.

These were used as part of a course I was a teaching assistant for at the University of Washington in the Winter of 2018 called "Quantum Computing for Electrical Engineers."
