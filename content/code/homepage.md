description: I coded this website from scratch (with the help of GPT4)
---

I developed this website from scratch without any major frameworks or platforms. Since I have minimal web development experience, my main motivation with this project was to see how far I could get using the help of GPT4.

The website is written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, however the structure is setup such that I can add new project pages, just by adding a new markdown file. This greatly simplifies maintenance as I can focus on the content of the page, rather than having to constantly hardcode new pages.

While there are certainly some shortcomings I will address in the future, I am quite happy with the result, and feel free to use any part of underlying code.
