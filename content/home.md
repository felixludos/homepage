# {greeting}!

I am a PhD student in the [Empirical Inference Department](https://ei.is.mpg.de/) at the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://is.mpg.de/). My research interests are in the field of machine learning, especially in the intersection of machine learning and physics. I am interested in developing new methods for learning from data, especially in the context of physical systems. I am also interested in applying machine learning to problems in physics, such as the analysis of molecular dynamics simulations or the simulation of quantum systems.

<!-- Currently, I am working at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems as a PhD student under the supervision of Bernhard Schölkopf and Stefan Bauer. I earned a Master’s degree in Computer Science in 2019 at the University of Washington, Seattle, USA, under Dieter Fox and Arunkumar Bryavan. Before that, I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Physics, and Chemistry in 2018. At that time, I worked with Lutz Maibaum on analyzing molecular dynamics simulations to characterize the structure of cellular membranes. I also worked with Boris Blinov on simulating trapped ions to improve cooling for storing and processing quantum information. -->
